## Enterprise

- Enterprise is a software for robots so that they are sentient; listen and respond to you, and you can teach it things so it can learn.

# Add in Knowledge 
- information in the knowledge folder is built in; but it can learn new things by running the script and teaching it by saying; please learn, and waiting for it to ask `what is?` and respond with the `keyword` you want to teach it then it will say the definition is: and you can give it the response verbally, then it will ask to confirm. Say `yes` or `no` to confirm or `repeat` to listen to what was heard from the robot's side.
